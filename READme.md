## Lab Walkthroughs

### Path to RCE

#### Objective

Understand how to exploit vulnerabilities to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) in the provided labs.

#### Steps

1. **Identify the Vulnerability**:

   - Scan the target application using tools like `nmap` or `Nikto`.
   - Look for injection points or misconfigurations.

2. **Exploit the Vulnerability**:

   - Use payloads from resources like `PayloadsAllTheThings`.
   - Inject malicious code to test for RCE.

3. **Confirm Execution**:

   - Verify successful execution by spawning a reverse shell or capturing the output.

4. **Mitigation Tips**:
   - Apply proper input validation.
   - Use Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) to monitor suspicious activities.

### Individual Lab Walkthroughs

Each lab has its own dedicated folder within this repository. Navigate to the respective folder to find a detailed walkthrough for that specific lab. Example:

- `Labs/Lab1`: Walkthrough for Lab 1
- `Labs/Lab2`: Walkthrough for Lab 2

These folders include step-by-step instructions, tools used, and screenshots (if applicable) to guide you through the process.
